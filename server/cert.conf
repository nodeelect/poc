# This variable is used as the base location of configuration files needed by
# easyrsa.  More specific variables for specific files (e.g., EASYRSA_SSL_CONF)
# may override this default.

# The default value of this variable is the location of the easyrsa script
# itself, which is also where the configuration files are located in the
# easy-rsa tree.

# Define X509 DN mode.
# This is used to adjust what elements are included in the Subject field as the DN
# (this is the "Distinguished Name.")
# Note that in cn_only mode the Organizational fields further below aren't used.
#
# Choices are:
#   cn_only  - use just a CN value
#   org      - use the "traditional" Country/Province/City/Org/OU/email/CN format

#set_var EASYRSA_DN	"cn_only"

# Organizational fields (used with 'org' mode and ignored in 'cn_only' mode.)
# These are the default values for fields which will be placed in the
# certificate.  Don't leave any of these fields blank, although interactively
# you may omit any specific field by typing the "." symbol (not valid for
# email.)

# Choose a size in bits for your keypairs. The recommended value is 2048.  Using
# 2048-bit keys is considered more than sufficient for many years into the
# future. Larger keysizes will slow down TLS negotiation and make key/DH param
# generation take much longer. Values up to 4096 should be accepted by most
# software. Only used when the crypto alg is rsa (see below.)

# parsed after this timeframe passes. It is only used for an expected next
# publication date.

# How many days before its expiration date a certificate is allowed to be
# renewed?

# This is best left alone. Interactively you will set this manually, and BATCH
